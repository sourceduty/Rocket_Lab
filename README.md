The resurgence in the popularity of space science and exploration can be attributed to several factors. Advancements in technology have significantly reduced the costs and increased the accessibility of space missions, making them more feasible and appealing. The involvement of private companies has introduced competitive practices that drive efficiency and innovation, leading to more frequent and ambitious missions. Additionally, the potential for economic benefits, such as resource extraction from asteroids and the development of new technologies, has captured public and governmental interest. The inspirational aspect of exploring the unknown and the possibility of ensuring humanity's long-term survival by becoming a multi-planetary species also play crucial roles in garnering support for space endeavors.

Modern rocket companies have been instrumental in inspiring renewed interest in space exploration. Companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin have developed reusable rocket technology, significantly reducing the cost of access to space and enabling more frequent launches.  Their ambitious goals, such as Mars colonization and lunar missions, have reignited public imagination and enthusiasm for space travel. Collaborations between these private companies and government agencies, like NASA's partnerships with SpaceX for the Artemis program, have further demonstrated the potential for successful public-private ventures in space exploration. These developments have collectively inspired a new generation to engage with and support space science and exploration initiatives.
